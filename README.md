[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This is in requirement of BT5153 Applied Machine Learning Term Paper. 
Dataset used : - https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small

This package includes two solutions:-
* Image Classification using Transfer Learning :-VGG19 and Inception V3
* Image Search using a custom CNN based AutoEncoder and Resnet50

# Image Classification

  - Three schemes to conduct product classification for e-commerce

#### VGG19 Architecture

* MODEL ARCHITECTURE
VGG-19 has 19 deep layers with unified kernel size of 3Ã—3

* LAYERS TUNED
Only the last 5 layers are re-trained with newly add-in 3 dense layers in order to predict the correct number of class for current study
  
* HYPER-PARAMETERS TUNED
Optimizer using adam with learning rate of 1e-5 and decay of 1e-6, new add-in layer with 512 hidden units with drop out rate of 0.5

* REGULARIZATION
Early stopping, reduce learning rate on plateau, drop-out, data augmentation (ONLY during training) are applied, weight sharing is done implicitly through convolution

#### InceptionV3 Architecture

* MODEL ARCHITECTURE
Inception V3 has 48 dense layers and stacks 11 inception modules, each consisting of pooling layers and convolutional filters

* LAYERS TUNED
All the layers are re-trained with newly add-in 3 dense layers in order to predict the correct number of class for current study

* HYPER-PARAMETERS TUNED
Optimizer using rmsprop with learning rate of 1e-4 and decay of 1e-6, new add-in layer with 128 hidden units with drop out rate of 0.4

* REGULARIZATION
Early stopping, reduce learning rate on plateau, drop-out, data augmentation (ONLY during training) are applied, weight sharing is done implicitly through convolution

##### Evaluation Metrics
      Accuracy,Precision and Recall
     
# Image Search

#### AutoEncoder using CNN Architecture

* MODEL ARCHITECTURE
CNN architecture is used to build AntoEncoder for image search. It comprises of both an Encoder and a Decoder. Embedding features is generated bythe Encoder.

* LAYERS DESIGN
Encoder consists of the first 7 layers
Decoder consists of the last 7 layers

* HYPER-PARAMETERS TUNED
Optimizer using adam with learning rate of 1e-5 and decay of 1e-6

* TRAINING
Autoencoders are self-supervised learning model with input and output being the image itself
